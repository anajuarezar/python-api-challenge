# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Background
--------
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

## Part I - WeatherPy

Using API's from OpenWeatherMap API and Google Maps, we were able to provide the following evidence of the relation between Latitude and Temperature

## Part II - VacationPy

With the help of Google Maps API's we were able to predict the BEST vactions! If you want to compare some possible hotels for your next destination and the temperature, use this map!!! :
